Practical Application Code Test

Task:

Spend no more than 3 hours working toward a program and description of architectural approach for a web application that provides unified search against two different open access online data repositories for ebooks; HathiTrust, and Project Gutenberg.

You don't have to finish the program; simply provide us some sample code and methods you may call alongside a high-level architectural discussion of how you would more fully implement this as an application.

Use whatever tools and frameworks you're comfortable with.

You will be evaluated on the following:

- Resourcefulness

  - Your ability to investigate open source repositories and their available interfaces.

  - Your ability to quickly synthesize the underlying technologies used and data models used by those repositories into a useful program.

- Practical Application and Creativity

  - Your ability to normalize objects from different data models into useful output.

  - Demonstrate your creativity and intuition as to how such a application would be used by patrons or librarians.

The content from both is provided as XML dumps (HathiTrust provides a [single large XML file](http://www.hathitrust.org/documents/non_google_pd_pdus.zip) [[documentation](http://www.hathitrust.org/datasets)], Project Gutenberg provides [a collection of RDF files](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/rdf-files.tar.zip) with one for each of their titles [[slight amount of documentation](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Feeds)]).
